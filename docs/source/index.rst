Welcome to Ambit Sentry's documentation!
===================================

**Ambit**  The Ambit SDP is a cutting-edge security solution 
designed to protect services, applications, data, and resources 
by cloaking them on the host system. 
It provides “just-in-time” access, ensuring only authenticated 
and authorized users or devices can interact with these resources. 
Ambit SDP also offers comprehensive visibility into network activity 
by capturing, monitoring, and analyzing packet flows in real time—all 
through a single management console.
